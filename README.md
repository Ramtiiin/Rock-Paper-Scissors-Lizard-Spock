# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla.

Sam Kass explains he created the expanded game because it seemed like most games of Rock Paper Scissors with people you know would end in a tie.

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock was first mentioned in the Big Bang Theory Series, Season 2 episode "The Lizard-Spock Expansion", the title of which references the game.

As Sheldon explains:
Scissors cuts Paper\n
Paper covers Rock\n
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
and as it always has, Rock crushes Scissors.


This is programming practice and my first project in Github :)
